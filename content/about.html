    I am currently a <a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/public-health-sciences-division/research/computational-biology/mahan-fellowship.html" target="_blank">Mahan Postdoctoral Fellow</a> with <a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/subramaniam-arvind.html" target="_blank">Arvind Rasi Subramaniam</a> and <a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/campbell-melody.html" target="_blank"> Melody G. Campbell</a> in the <a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/basic-sciences-division.html" target="_blank">Divison of Basic Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html" target="_blank">Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</a>. My current research involves using structural and genomic approaches to study ribosome stalling, translational regulation, and membrane protiens.

<p>
    I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.chbe.illinois.edu" target="_blank">Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://chbe.illinois.edu/directory/profile/diwakar" target="_blank">Diwakar Shukla</a>. My thesis research focused on characterizing conformational dynamics and molecular regulatory mechanisms of membrane transport proteins using molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state models.

<p>
    Prior to my graduate studies, I received my Bachelor of Science in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/engineering/bme/" target="_blank">Biomedical Engineering</a> and <a href="https://www.uab.edu/cas/mathematics/" target="_blank">Applied Mathematics</a> at <a href="https://uab.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Alabama at Birmingham</a>. I conducted my undergradute research with Dr. Margaret A. Johnson in the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/cas/chemistry/" target="_blank">Department of Chemistry</a> investigating functional mechanisms of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases and coronaviral non-structural proteins using solution NMR.
