## Hello! My name is Matthew.

I am currently a [Mahan Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/public-health-sciences-division/research/computational-biology/mahan-fellowship.html) with [Dr. Arvind Rasi Subramaniam](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/subramaniam-arvind.html) and [Dr. Melody G. Campbell](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/campbell-melody.html) in the [Division of Basic Sciences](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/basic-sciences-division.html) at the [Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html). My current research interests involve using structural and genomic approaches to study ribosome stalling and translational regulation. 

I completed my Ph.D. in [Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](https://www.chbe.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Diwakar Shukla](https://chbe.illinois.edu/directory/profile/diwakar). My thesis research focused on characterizing conformational dynamics and regulation of membrane transport proteins using molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state models. 

Prior to my graduate studies, I received my Bachelor of Science in [Biomedical Engineering](https://www.uab.edu/engineering/bme/) and [Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computation](https://www.uab.edu/cas/mathematics/) from the [University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://www.uab.edu/).
